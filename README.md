# hello-world
A test repository made following the Hello World guide.

This guide requires me to write a little about myself. Well, my name is **Jonathan Sims**, though I prefer to just go by **Jon** or **Sims**, or whatever my 
screenname is. I am a bit of an artist, and I like to create digital art in my free time when I'm not playing video games or making internet videos. I am
studying game development, specifically the multi-media production side of things. In the future I hope to be able to create all types of media for a myriad of 
purposes.
